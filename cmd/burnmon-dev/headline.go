// total should "visibly roll" every tick; in practice it only moved on
// vendorStrip's own 60s cache refresh (startSlowRefreshers, app.go), so
// most ticks painted the same number (2026-09-26 phase 5 fix). This adds
// whatever the shared tick's own already-fetched live.ChartWindow events
// carry past the cache's own GeneratedAt moment, so bdevSnapshotNow's
// headline field reflects real ingestion every tick without a second,
// full-store query.

// headlineTodayTokens returns today's running total: vendorStrip's own
// cached Today figure, plus tokens from any event in events (the shared
// tick's own live.ChartWindow fetch, comfortably wider than the cache's 60s
// refresh cadence) that landed after the cache's GeneratedAt moment - so a
// turn ingested since the last cache refresh shows up immediately instead
// of waiting up to a minute for the next one. Filtering strictly on
// e.At.After(cacheTime) means an event the cache already counted (at or
// before that moment) is never added twice, regardless of how stale the
// cache is.
//
// A cacheGeneratedAt older than today's own start means the cache was
// built before the day rolled over (the app sat idle across midnight): the
// cached Today figure describes a day that has already ended, so it is
// dropped rather than carried forward, and today starts from whatever the
// fetched window alone can see. That is a real reset, not the "jump back"
// this function must otherwise avoid: normally, the returned total should
// never be smaller than the previous tick's, since each tick's cache base
// only grows and its delta only adds events after that same, unmoving
// cache moment.
//
// One gap this function alone cannot close (found by review, 2026-09-26):
// if vendor_strip's own 60s refresh (startSlowRefreshers, app.go) stalls
// for longer than live.ChartWindow - a sustained store error, not just a
// sleep/wake, which refreshes within one tick - cacheGeneratedAt falls
// behind events' own window start. Every fetched event is then "after
// cacheTime" and gets added on top of the stale base, but tokens from the
// gap between cacheTime and the window start are in neither, silently
// missing. Worse, as those already-counted events age out of the sliding
// window on later ticks, the sum they contributed shrinks, so the total
// would visibly dip. headlineTodayMonotonic below is the guard: call that,
// not this function directly, from bdevSnapshotNow.

// during headlineTodayTokens' own documented gap (a vendor_strip refresh
// stalled past live.ChartWindow). A day boundary always resets the floor
// rather than clamping the new day's low starting total against the old
// day's high one - that reset is intentional, not the jump back this
